_**0. Simple web stack**_  
A lot of websites are powered by simple web infrastructure, a lot of time it is composed of a single server with a [LAMP stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29).  

On a whiteboard, design a one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via `www.foobar.com`. Start your explanation by having a user wanting to access your website.

_**1. Distributed web infrastructure**_  
On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website `www.foobar.com`.

_**2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure**_  
On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website `www.foobar.com`, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic, and be monitored.
